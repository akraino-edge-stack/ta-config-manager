This project provides an implementation for a generic configuration management
framework. The framework provides the following:
* Interfaces for getting, setting or deleting of configuration data.
* Interfaces for taking a backup of configuration data.
* Interfaces for restoring the configuration data from a previously taken
  backup.
* A CLI for manipulating the configuration data.
* A plugin based interface for validating the change in configuration data.
* A plugin based interface for activating the change in configuration data.

At the highlevel, the framework surves the following purposes:
* Provides a unified interface for manipulating the configuration data.
* Isolate the configuration management users from changes in the used backend.
